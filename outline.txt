  - Explain using pics and sample code
  - Cover about channels itself for those unfamiliar with channels and goroutines
  - Cover about Go itself for those unfamiliar with Go language

Using delve debugger explain the structure of a channel

Run the program, study the inner workings of Go's channels

Once you build a fair understanding, then read and understand further
