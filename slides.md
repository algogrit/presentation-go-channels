      "Content": "Much has been said about the clarity and performance of the TV. Yes its a great value for money product, but here I am going to say about the customer service part. After using my 49 inch TV for about 21 months one day my TV went black. I could hear only the sound but no picture. I emailed the Sanyo customer care and within four hours a service person called me and fixed the appointment for very next day. The next day he inspected the TV and told that the panel has gone dead and they will have to change the panel. As my TV was under 2 year warranty he assured me that the company will possibly replace the panel and it could be done within 10 days. I was very much skeptical about the panel replacement as the next day I received an email from the company saying that they will be taking all possible actions to solve my query but no mention of panel replacement. After about a week I received a call from their service center in Bilimora that my tv has arrived and the service person is coming to install it. Even though it was raining heavily on that day he came right on time and to my amazement he brought out from his car a whole new TV box. Believe me the company has replaced a whole new tv in place of the old one, only the two boards from my old tv were fixed on the new one. Really hats off to the Company's customer service and special mention to their service centre in Bilimora which got the job done on time even in heavy rainfall and even though my hometown is about 25 kms away. Within the next two hours I received three calls from the company regarding my query solved. Thanks Sanyo..... Really satisfied on buying your company's TV."
